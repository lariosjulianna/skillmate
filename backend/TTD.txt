For this week's TTD, Dixon and I worked on the basic filtering logic.
The goal was to be able to filter users by different attributes.

Test #1: Test the program
Status: Fail
Reasoning: There was no code yet

Test #2: Randomize the User
Status: Fail
Reasoning: Wasn't properly linked to database

Test #3: Radnomize the User
Status: Succes
Reasoning: One random user in the database was chosen and displayed

Test #4: Multiple Filtering Queries:
Status: Fail
Reasoning: Not enough sample data with overlap in the database, and
SQL syntax error

Test #5: Singular Filtering Queries
Status: Success
Reasoning: Any user that fit a singular filter was shown 

Overall: this was considered a success. The tests that we wanted to 
pass passed, and the bonus tests (multiple filtering queries - 
queries with multiple filters) failed, which was expected. If we had 
more time, we definitely could have made it work by adding more sample 
data or just by fixing the syntax errors. 

In the future, we would do this again, as a second set of eyes
was definitely useful in order to spot errors before they were made.
